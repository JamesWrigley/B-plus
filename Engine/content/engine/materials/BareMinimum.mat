# This is an example of a material for the engine's material system.
# This is the simplest-possible kind of Material,
#     which the other Material types inherit from.
# It passes the model vertices through without transformation,
#    and multiplies their color with some color based on a uniform.
# The way that color is selected is unnecessarily complicated
#    to thoroughly illustrate the different parts of this format.
